Octopus! re-encodes .mp3, .wav, .aac, flac and .m4a sound files to high quality mp3.

Octopus! makes your music have consistent quality.

# You will need to normalize the tracks after Octopus! is done.
# I recommend http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/ Linux and OS X
# versions are available. Track gain @ 89 db recommended.

# Binaries needed:
# - Faad2 http://www.audiocoding.com/faad2.html
# - Flac https://xiph.org/flac/download.html
# - Lame http://lame.sourceforge.net/

Python (2.6 or 2.7) needed.
